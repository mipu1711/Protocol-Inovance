# C# Protocol for Connecting to Inovance PLCs

The protocol for connecting C# with Inovance PLCs includes **AM600**, **H3U**, **H5U**, and **EASY** series.

## Features

This project supports the following features:

*   Connect to Inovance PLCs via Ethernet (using Modbus TCP).
*   Read and write data to PLC registers.
*   Set and clear PLC bits.
*   Execute PLC commands.
*   Monitor PLC status.
*   Handle errors.

## How to Use
Copy the following two DLL files into the bin/Debug folder:
ModbusTcpAPI.dll.
StandardModbusApi.dll.

## Requirements

1. Support for Inovance PLC series **AM600**, **H3U**, **H5U**, and **EASY**.
3. AutoShop can be used to simulate Inovance PLC models H5U and EASY (H3U does not support simulation).
